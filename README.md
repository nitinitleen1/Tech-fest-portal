This is a small C program for tech fest management system.

The program consists of two ways viz.
*  Admin
*  User

### Admin Menu
 The ultimate right of everything lies with the admin.

1. Admin can add, modify and access information of events.
2. change password
3. Access list of users event wise and of all events
 


### USer Menu 
The user further has 2 ways :
1. New User:When a person is not registered with us and want to become a part of the Fest. This is the menu
2. Old User: Person who is already registered can do:
  1. Register for new events.
  2. View the already registered events.
  3. Change password.
  4. View Schedule of the fest.



We have tried to `encrypt` the password but its the most `basic encryption` using ascii values only.
`Password Strictness` is included due to which password can only be 8-13 characters long consisting:
1. An Uppercase Letter.
2. a lowecase letter.
3. a number.
4. a special character.
